	<string>Installs the major version of Parallels Desktop specified by MAJOR_VERSION. This recipe has been tested with major versions 9 through 16.

For major versions 9 through 15, leave the PLATFORM_ARCH blank in your override.

For major version 16, set the PLATFORM_ARCH in your override to either "intel" or "m1" depending on your desired architecture.
		
For major version 17, set the PLATFORM_ARCH in your override to "image"	

This recipe differs from the one in keeleysam-recipes because it offers code signature verification, does not require a ParallelsURLProvider processor, and also includes pkg and install recipes.</string>
